## 🔧 Data Preparation (Manual Cleaning)

The raw data required cleaning before visualization, so the following steps were completed manually in Excel:

- Removed duplicates and empty rows  
- Corrected inconsistent text values (countries, roast names, etc.)  
- Fixed date formats and number formats  
- Merged multiple sheets into a single well-structured table  
- Applied proper data types for analysis  
- Prepared the final dataset for PivotTables, PivotCharts, slicers, and timeline

No Power Query or automation tools were used.
